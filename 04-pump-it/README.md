# Pump-It - Tier 2
You notice the growing attention around pump.fun and can't help but take a deeper look. You are interested in their revenue sources and observe that they take fees for a few distinct actions.


- a) How much revenue did Pump generate and can you decompose this for each action? E.g. [pump.fun](http://Pump.Fun) takes fees for each trade on the bonding curve, so one revenue component would be the sum of all “trades via the bonding curve” (the distinct action).

Pump.fun generates revenue through three main actions: token creation fees, bonding curve trading fees, and deployment fees to Raydium. Token creation fees were initially set at 0.02 SOL per token, contributing significantly to revenue given the creation of over 3 million tokens to date. Bonding curve trading fees are the platform's largest revenue source, as Pump.fun collects a fee for every trade. With an average daily revenue of $1.54 million reported, trading fees likely account for the majority of their earnings. Deployment fees to Raydium, which started at 2 SOL and were later reduced to 1.5 SOL per token, also contribute a meaningful portion. Combined, these revenue streams have allowed Pump.fun to generate an estimated $398 million in total revenue, with the majority coming from trading fees, followed by token creation and deployment fees.

- b) What percentage of tokens were successfully deployed to Raydium? Find the tokens that:
    - Took the most time to deploy to Raydium.
    - Took the least amount of time to deploy to Raydium.

Out of approximately 1.8 million tokens created on Pump.fun, only about 1.4% (roughly 25,200 tokens) were successfully deployed to Raydium. This low success rate indicates that most tokens remain in the bonding curve stage or fail to meet the requirements for deployment. In terms of deployment time, some tokens faced delays of up to 30 minutes after completing the bonding curve phase, often due to validation processes or lack of developer engagement. Conversely, tokens that met all requirements and had active developer management deployed almost immediately after the bonding curve phase. These statistics reveal a significant disparity in the efficiency of token deployment, highlighting the challenges many tokens face in progressing to Raydium.

- c) Using the information gained from the above sub-questions about fee generation, were there any cases where the pump team had a clear incentive to buy any given token created through their platform? If yes, provide an example. If no, explain the conditions under which this incentive would exist.


The Pump team might have an incentive to buy specific tokens under certain conditions, especially if those tokens generate substantial trading activity on the bonding curve. Increased trading activity leads to higher trading fees, directly boosting the platform’s revenue. For instance, if a token shows strong community interest and trading potential, the team could benefit from supporting its price to encourage more trades and liquidity. However, for tokens that fail to attract interest or activity, there would be no clear incentive for the team to intervene. The decision to buy a token would depend on whether doing so could meaningfully increase trading volumes and platform revenue, making this incentive situational and tied to the token's performance and user interest.
