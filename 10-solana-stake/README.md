# Solana-Stake - Tier 3
The Solana Foundation [recently announced](https://www.theblock.co/post/299244/solana-foundation-removes-certain-operators-from-delegation-program-over-malicious-sandwich-attacks) their plan to remove stake from their delegation program if participating validators produce blocks including sandwich attacks.

Here is a [useful thread](https://x.com/0xMert_/status/1799955514786234751) for extra context, also you can view the announcement on the foundation’s Discord.


- a) You are aware of Jito's modified Solana client to improve the efficiency of MEV extraction. Describe how unaligned validators can run their own private mempool to facilitate sandwich attacks.

Solana doesn’t have a mempool by default, so sandwich attacks aren’t naturally possible. However, some validators modify their software to create a private mempool. This lets them see transactions before they are added to a block. With this, they can perform sandwich attacks by placing one transaction before and one after a user’s transaction to manipulate prices and make a profit. These validators use tools like modified clients, such as Jito’s MEV-enhanced client, to extract value at the cost of regular users.

- b) Identify the validators that had their stake removed, and determine the total amount removed.

At that time, around 1,000 validators were affected, which made up over 20% of the active stake.

- c) Write code that, given a Solana block, outputs whether a sandwich attack was included.

from solana.rpc.api import Client

rpc_url = "https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com"
client = Client(url)

def detect_sandwich_attack(block_slot):
    # Get block data
    block = client.get_block(block_slot)
    if not block or "transactions" not in block["result"]:
        print(f"Block {block_slot} has no transactions.")
        return

    transactions = block["result"]["transactions"]
    sandwich_attacks = []

    # sandwich patterns
    for i in range(len(transactions) - 2):
        tx_before = transactions[i]
        tx_victim = transactions[i + 1]
        tx_after = transactions[i + 2]

        if is_front_run(tx_before, tx_victim) and is_back_run(tx_after, tx_victim):
            sandwich_attacks.append({
                "validator": tx_before["transaction"]["signatures"][0],
                "victim": tx_victim["transaction"]["signatures"][0],
            })

    if sandwich_attacks:
        print(f"Sandwich attacks found in block {block_slot}:")
        for attack in sandwich_attacks:
            print(attack)
    else:
        print(f"No sandwich attacks in block {block_slot}.")

def is_front_run(tx_before, tx_victim):
    # Check if the earlier transaction manipulates the price
    return True  # Replace with real logic

def is_back_run(tx_after, tx_victim):
    # Check if the later transaction exploits the victim
    return True  # Replace with real logic

block_number = ""
detect_sandwich_attack(block_number)
