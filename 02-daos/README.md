# DAOs - Tier 1
You’re a DeFi enthusiast who spends a lot of time participating in and analyzing DAOs, their governance contracts, and their overall level of participation. Over the past couple of years, the market has slowed down and you’ve begun to notice that some DAOs are not the same as they used to be.


- a) Identify a set of DAOs that are most vulnerable to an economic governance attack, describe how it may be achieved, and estimate the cost to the attacker.


Over the past few years, the slowdown in the market has exposed vulnerabilities in some DAOs, especially smaller or inactive ones. DAOs that rely heavily on token-weighted voting without safeguards are the most vulnerable to economic governance attacks. Smaller DAOs with low market caps, inactive DAOs with minimal voter participation, and those where voting power is purely based on token holdings are prime targets. An economic governance attack occurs when an attacker acquires a large portion of governance tokens, either through direct purchase or flash loans, and uses their voting power to pass malicious proposals. For example, an attacker could buy up enough tokens to secure majority voting power, submit a proposal to drain the DAO’s treasury, and use their control to execute the proposal. The cost to the attacker depends on the DAO's token price and market liquidity. For instance, if a DAO has 10 million tokens in circulation and the attacker needs to control 51% of the tokens at $1 each, the attack might cost $5.1 million. However, in smaller DAOs with lower liquidity, the cost could drop significantly, especially if flash loans are utilized.

- b) For vulnerable DAOs, estimate and describe the potential benefit for the attacker i.e., how much of the DAO’s treasury is at risk of being stolen? (it can also be a parameter change)

The potential benefits for attackers can be immense. One of the most straightforward exploits involves stealing from the DAO’s treasury. If a DAO’s treasury contains $10 million in assets, an attacker could potentially siphon off the entire amount. If the attack cost $5 million in token acquisition, the attacker would walk away with a $5 million profit. Another potential benefit involves changing critical parameters of the DAO. For example, the attacker could manipulate tokenomics by minting new tokens for themselves or modifying rules governing rewards and fees, effectively extracting value over time. For example, if a DAO controls a stablecoin pool worth $50 million, a parameter change could enable the attacker to withdraw a significant portion of the pool.

To illustrate, consider a hypothetical DAO, ExampleDAO, with a $2 million treasury in ETH and a token price of $2. If only 10% of the 5 million circulating tokens (500,000 tokens) typically participate in votes, the attacker would need just over 260,000 tokens to gain majority control. At $2 per token, this would cost around $520,000. With majority control, the attacker could pass a proposal to transfer the $2 million treasury, yielding a profit of $1.48 million. These vulnerabilities underscore the importance of safeguards like quorum requirements, time locks, and withdrawal limits. Without such measures, smaller or inactive DAOs remain at significant risk of economic governance attacks.
